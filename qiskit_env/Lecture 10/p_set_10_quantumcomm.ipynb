    "To verify successful quantum teleportation in both simulations and real experiments, researchers use quantum state tomography. This technique reconstructs the quantum state by performing a series of measurements from different angles, allowing for a comprehensive comparison between the original and teleported states. In practice, this involves measuring various properties of the quantum system to piece together its exact state. By comparing the reconstructed state with the initial one, scientists can determine the fidelity of the teleportation process. This method has been effectively employed in numerous experimental demonstrations of quantum teleportation, providing a reliable means to assess and confirm the accuracy of the process. The issue is that with QKD, you can use quantum tomography to verify a valid channel, however, when actually using the channel for a secure exchange, you are required to know what the original state was before hand which violates the **secure** part - which is the whole point.
